        <h2>10 Accessibility Mistakes Everyone Makes</h2>
        <p class="post-meta">Published May 28, 2023 • 8 min read</p>
        <p>From poor contrast ratios to missing alt text, most websites have accessibility issues. Learn the
            most common pitfalls and how to fix them to make your sites usable by everyone...Accessibility in web design
            ensures that websites and applications are usable by people with disabilities, including visual, auditory,
            motor, and cognitive impairments. Despite growing awareness, many developers and designers still make common
            accessibility mistakes that significantly hinder user experience for millions of people. One of the most
            frequent mistakes is the lack of **alternative text for images**. When images are not described using the
            `alt` attribute, screen readers cannot convey the image’s purpose to visually impaired users, leaving them
            without critical content or context. Similarly, **poor color contrast** is a widespread issue. Many
            designers choose aesthetic color combinations that look good visually but fail to provide enough contrast
            between text and background, making content difficult or impossible to read for users with low vision or
            color blindness.

            for everything, it creates confusion and reduces the usability of assistive
            technologies. Additionally, **missing or improper use of labels in forms** can make form
            inputs difficult to navigate. Screen readers rely on labels to explain the purpose of
            each input field. Without these labels, users might not know what information to enter,
            especially if visual cues are not accessible.

            **Keyboard accessibility** is another common area where mistakes happen. Many developers
            design interfaces that rely heavily on mouse interactions, ignoring the fact that some
            users navigate entirely using a keyboard or other assistive devices. Elements such as
            buttons, links, and form fields must be reachable and operable using the Tab key, and
            visual indicators (focus styles) must clearly show which element is active. Failing to
            include proper **focus management** can leave users “lost” in the interface. Similarly,
            **inaccessible pop-ups and modal dialogs** are a frequent barrier. If focus doesn’t
            shift properly when a modal opens or if the modal can’t be dismissed via keyboard, users
            may be trapped.

            One often overlooked mistake is **missing skip navigation links**. These links allow
            keyboard users to bypass repetitive content, like menus, and jump directly to the main
            content. Without them, users have to tab through every menu item on every page, leading
            to frustration. Additionally, **relying solely on visual cues** such as color to convey
            information is problematic. For example, marking errors in red without an accompanying
            icon or text label will confuse users with color blindness.

            Finally, a critical and common oversight is **not testing with real assistive
            technologies**. Developers might assume their site is accessible because it “looks good”
            or passes automated tests, but true accessibility can only be verified through manual
            testing with screen readers, keyboards, and tools like VoiceOver or NVDA. Ignoring
            accessibility doesn’t just affect users—it can lead to legal consequences under
            accessibility laws like the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) or Web Content
            Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG). In short, by recognizing and correcting these common
            accessibility mistakes, designers and developers can create more inclusive,
            user-friendly experiences for everyone, regardless of their abilities.
