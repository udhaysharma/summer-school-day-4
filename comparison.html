        <h2>CSS Grid vs Flexbox: When to Use Each</h2>
        <p class="post-meta">Published June 8, 2023 • 7 min read</p>
        <p>Both CSS Grid and Flexbox are powerful layout tools, but they solve different problems. Grid excels at
            two-dimensional layouts while Flexbox is ideal for one-dimensional flows. Learn when to use each...CSS Grid
            and Flexbox are two of the most powerful layout systems in modern web development. Although both are used to
            create responsive and organized web designs, they serve different purposes and have distinct
            characteristics. Flexbox, short for Flexible Box Layout, is a one-dimensional layout model. This means it
            works in a single direction—either row or column. It is best suited for linear layouts where items are
            arranged in a single line, such as navigation menus, button groups, or toolbars. Flexbox excels at
            distributing space and aligning items within a container, especially when the size of the items is unknown
            or dynamic.

            On the other hand, CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system, which allows you to control layout in both
            rows and columns simultaneously. This makes Grid particularly useful for more complex page layouts like
            dashboards, image galleries, or full web pages where precise placement of elements is required. With
            properties such as `grid-template-areas`, `grid-template-columns`, and `grid-template-rows`, developers can
            create structured and scalable layouts with minimal code. Grid also allows overlapping items and offers more
            control over spacing and positioning than Flexbox.

            While Flexbox is simpler and easier to use for small-scale or content-driven layouts, Grid is better for
            larger and more rigid structures. Flexbox responds well to content changes, adjusting the layout
            automatically, while Grid gives more control through defined tracks and areas. Both systems are responsive,
            but Grid has advanced features like `auto-fill` and `auto-fit` which enhance its flexibility in creating
            dynamic designs. In terms of browser support, Flexbox has been around longer and works on older browsers
            like Internet Explorer 11, while Grid is fully supported in all modern browsers but lacks support in some
            legacy ones.

            In practical web design, it’s common to use both Flexbox and Grid together. For example, Grid might be used
            to define the overall page layout, while Flexbox is applied within individual components like navbars or
            cards. Rather than choosing one over the other, developers often combine their strengths to achieve cleaner,
            more adaptable, and responsive designs. Understanding when and how to use each layout system helps in
            building better-structured and visually appealing web pages. Ultimately, CSS Grid and Flexbox are
            complementary tools that, when mastered, provide web developers with the flexibility and power to create any
            layout imaginable.
